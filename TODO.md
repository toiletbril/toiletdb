# TODO:
- Dynamic ID uniqueness checking.
- Templates for column classes?
- Class for table creation.
- Remove private struct from parsed, because it is not exposed.
- Non in-memory version. (this would become actually useful and it will be cool if I build something else using this library)
- Table creator for CLI.
- Documentation.
- Tests.
