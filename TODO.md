# TODO
- Clean up more. This was written when I was learning rapidly, so some code may
  be not as clear as I want.
- Update index on insertion/deletion more efficiently.
- Make sure that all IDs are unique.
- DB creator/editor.
- Tests.
- Alternative class to use disk instead of memory. (This would actually become
  useful)
