# toiletdb

In-memory database with an ability to serialize into a file and a CLI for it.

Implemented as a database of students. For now, file format looks like this:
```
|<ID>|<name>|<surname>|<group name>|<record book number>|
```

As this was my first project in C++, I finally understand why people don't like it :3c
