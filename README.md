# toiletdb

CLI for in-memory database with ability to serialize into file.

Implemented as a database of students. For now, file format looks like this:
```
|<name>|<surname>|<group name>|<record book number>|
```

As this was my first project in C++, I finally understand why people don't like it :3c
